This projects Implements approximate sting matching algorithm on according to the ieee research paper "Supporting Uncertain Predicates in DBMS Using
Approximate String Matching andProbabilistic Databases"

impl2 is the module file with all the functions, impl3 is the executable file. 
The changes/results can be viewed in db browser, the results table is dropped after the code stops running
